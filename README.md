# C-Sharp

This repository will contain all C# projects that I worked on.

# Projects:
- Car Insurance
- University Student Database

# Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics the website for a car insurance company. The user inputs information about themselves, their car, and driving history. A quote is then calculated based on the companies policy information and business logic. There is an admin page that allows the company to view all issued quotes. 

# University Student Database
This is a code-first Entity Framework project. It takes in input about a student. Their id, name, date of enrollment, courses, and grades are all submitted. The database is then created and can be viewed under the 'Students' tab.
